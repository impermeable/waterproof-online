# Waterproof online

There are two options to run Waterproof exercise in your browser: opening exercises in [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) or through Github codespaces.
The first option is completely free and does not need any account.
For the second option you need a github account, but the advantage is that in general it will be a bit faster.

To open the exercises in Github codespaces, you can click on the following link.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/impermeable/waterproof-online?quickstart=1)

This link should give you the option of continuing in an earlier opened workspace, if you have opened these exercises in codespaces before.

Tip: make sure you close your Github codespace envorinment after using it.
