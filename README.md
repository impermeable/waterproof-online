# Waterproof online

There are two options to run Waterproof exercise in your browser: through Gitpod and through Github codespaces. Both services provide a free number of hours per month.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/impermeable/waterproof-online)

Please note that the above link always opens up a new workspace. If you want to resume a previously opened workspace, then it is better to visit [https://gitpod.io/workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces).

To open the exercises in Github codespaces, you can click on the following link.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/impermeable/waterproof-online?quickstart=1)

This link should give you the option of continuing in an earlier opened workspace, if you have opened these exercises in codespaces before.

Tip: make sure you close your Gitpod workspace or Github codespace envorinment after using it.
